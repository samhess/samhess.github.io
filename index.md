## Crypto Portflio Manager (CPM)
This is a tool to manage your portfolio of crypto assets. CoinMarketCap does not show the market share of a certain cryto asset but CPM will calculate it. You can define a portfolio (real or virtual) and adjust the shares of your portfolio with the market share of a certain asset.
Your data will be stored in the localStorage of the browser. [Run CPM from here](https://samhess.github.io/crypto-portfolio-manager/index.html) or go to the [repo](https://github.com/samhess/crypto-portfolio-manager) if you are interested in the source code or contributing.
